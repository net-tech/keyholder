# Keyholder

Keyholder is a Discord Bot that allows Server Admins to verify if a backup account belongs to an existing staff member.

## How it works

1. Staff member runs /key generate when onboarded and is instructed to write it down IRL(In-Real-Life).

2. Once/If the staff member is compromised, they contact a Server Admin and give them the key they have written down.

3. The Server Admin runs /key authenticate and sees whether the key is valid.


## FAQ

#### Can I self-host Keyholder?

Yes. Feel free to check out the Run Locally section once the bot is finished.

#### Is Keyholder available as a public, hosted bot?

Yes. Check out the Installation section once the bot is finished.

#### I taught/educated my staff about scams. Do I need Keyholder?

This is a question I can't answer for you. You are free to invite Keyholder whenever you want. Whether you will is up to you.

#### Who can access the key of a Staff Member?

After it's been created? No one. Before entering the database, all keys are generated randomly and are [hashed](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/hashing). The key is only shown to the Staff Member once and never after. Server admins cannot regenerate the key.

#### What do keys look like?

Keys are 16 to 19-character long alphanumerical uppercase and lowercase texts. An example key, `saXo7RlfRig0PRaK` would take 173 billion years to crack.
